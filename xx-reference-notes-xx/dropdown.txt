Why Use useMemo?

Performance Optimization:
useMemo helps prevent unnecessary re-renders of the context consumers by ensuring that the context value only changes when the registerItem function changes.
Without useMemo, every render of the DropDownItems component would create a new object for the contextValue, which would trigger re-renders of all context consumers (all DropDownItem components).

Why It Might Seem Redundant Here:
Since registerItem is already memoized with useCallback, it has a stable identity unless its dependencies change. This means the contextValue object itself doesnâ€™t change unnecessarily.
In this case, passing registerItem directly to the context provider would work similarly because the registerItem function doesn't change on every render due to useCallback.

Using useMemo for Consistency:
It's a common practice to wrap context values with useMemo to ensure that all dependencies are taken into account and to provide a consistent pattern for maintaining context values. This ensures that any additional values added to the context in the future also benefit from memoization without additional changes.
